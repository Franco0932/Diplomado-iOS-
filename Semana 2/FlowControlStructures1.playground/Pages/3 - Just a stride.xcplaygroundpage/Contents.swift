 - Important:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not** modify any other part of the code except where comments explicitly indicate changes. If you do, **your experiment will be cancelled and not reviewed.**
 
 * Experiment:
    1. How many increments of 15 are in the range zero **through** 285? Add them to the `throughCounter` variable. Also, print each increment.
    2. How many increments of 4 are in the range zero **to** 60? Add them to the `toCounter` variable. Also, print each increment.
 
    **Notes:**
    \
        - **Do not** use fixed arrays. That's cheating üò°
    \
        - **Hint:** Find the difference between this exercise's title and Jem's song.
