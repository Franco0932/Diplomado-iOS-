 - Important:
⚠️ **Do not** modify any other part of the code except where comments explicitly indicate changes. If you do, **your experiment will be cancelled and not reviewed.**
 
 * Experiment:
 Write a function called siftBeans(fromGroceryList:) that takes a grocery list (as an array of strings) and “sifts out” the beans from the other groceries. The function should take one argument that has a parameter name called list, and it should return a named tuple of the type (beans: [String], otherGroceries: [String]).
 \
 \
    **Hint:** You may need to use a function on the String type called hasSuffix(_:)
